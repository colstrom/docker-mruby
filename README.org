* Overview

This repository contains a complete pipeline to build ~mruby~ on Docker.

[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colstrom/docker-mruby/develop/docs/images/mruby-full.png]]

* Usage

** Cloning the Repository

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/colstrom/docker-mruby.git
#+END_SRC

** (Optional) Deploying Concourse with Vagrant

This pipeline is intended for deployment with [[https://concourse.ci/][Concourse]]. If you do do not have
an existing Concourse deployment, you can use the included ~Vagrantfile~ to
create one locally with ~vagrant~.

You can skip this if you already have Concourse.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  vagrant up
#+END_SRC

** Deploying the Pipeline

The simplest deployment requires no configuration, but is unable to publish the
artifacts it builds.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  scripts/deploy-pipelines
#+END_SRC

** Adding Your Secrets

For the final output step to be useful, it needs somewhere to push. Since that
is an authenticated resource, you will need to supply some _secrets_ of your
own.

Conventionally we place these in a ~secrets.yaml~ file, which is included in the
~.gitignore~ for the repository, to prevent accidental publication of secrets.
If you prefer a different location, set ~$SECRETS~ in your environment to the
path you wish to use.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  docker-repository: repository/image
  docker-email: user@example.local
  docker-username: YOUR-USERNAME
  docker-password: YOUR-PASSWORD
#+END_SRC

** Deploying Your Secrets (with the Pipeline)

... or the other way around, if you prefer to read it that way.

~scripts/deploy-pipelines~ will detect if secrets are available, and deploy the
pipeline accordingly.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  scripts/deploy-pipelines
#+END_SRC
